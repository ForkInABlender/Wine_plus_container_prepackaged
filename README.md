# Wine_plus_container_prepackaged
This repo will store public copies of prebuilt &amp; precustomized wine containers. <br>
The point of this repo is to share prebuilt containers. Most of the configuration will have its own readme file & subfolder. <br>

# Why does this exist & why not just use Windows? <br>
Because wine is under constant enough development that any change Microsoft makes they attempt to adapt to it as best as possible. Anything that has that much consistency to change & adapt as other things change might be future proof. And I see Wine as being more future proof than Windows because wine can and will adopt its execution model in linux. And Windows OS versions take a lot longer to put together than various types of linux OSes or updates to graphics drivers. <br>

# What comes with it and can we make requests for custom containers to be made and open-sourced?
Yes, please open a issues request & put in the header "custom container request" with the name & date, then add details as per normal. I will attempt to get back to you as soon as I can.

# How readable will the documentation be?

I will try to keep it comprehensive. Eventually, I will need someone to translate my documentation. I want the documentation to be readable by everyone who wants to learn how to pen test the right way before gaining mastery of reverse engineering. This is also to proof where a thing needs improvement. Not just in Windows but also in Linux like (o)perating (s)ystems. It should remain fairly comprehendable.

# What does the project currently rely on?

* wine
* winetricks
