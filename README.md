# Wine_plus_container_prepackaged
This repo will store public copies of prebuilt &amp; precustomized wine containers. <br>
The point of this repo is to share prebuilt containers. Most of the configuration will have its own readme file & subfolder. <br>

# Why does this exist & why not just use Windows? <br>
Because wine is under constant enough development that any change Microsoft makes they attempt to adapt to it as best as possible. Anything that has that much consistency to change & adapt as other things change might be future proof. And I see Wine as being more future proof than Windows because wine can and will adopt its execution model in linux. And Windows OS versions take a lot longer to put together than various types of linux OSes or updates to graphics drivers. <br>

# What comes with it and can we make requests for custom containers to be made and open-sourced?
Yes, please open a issues request & put in the header "custom container request" with the name & date, then add details as per normal. I will attempt to get back to you as soon as I can.

# How readable will the documentation be?

I will try to keep it comprehensive. Eventually, I will need someone to translate my documentation. I want the documentation to be readable by everyone who wants to learn how to pen test the right way before gaining mastery of reverse engineering. This is also to proof where a thing needs improvement. Not just in Windows but also in Linux like (o)perating (s)ystems. It should remain fairly comprehendable.

# What does the project currently rely on?
the current dependencies are as follows:
* wine
* winetricks
* VirtualGL
* Python
* Java
* Directx
* Gallium
* Vulkan
* D3d9
* bash scripting knowledge

# What tool or set of tools are you using to make this repo/content possible?
https://replit.com/ by setting up or forking a repo and then tinkering on it til it works. I will be templating my work from here https://replit.com/@DylanEliot/Wine-FINALLY#main.sh which is also stored in a zip file. Their will be a date & time associated with each release/version.

# What can be expected? What would reliable documentation mean to you?

What can be expected is changes to the list of valid configuration as an addative change. Each unique change will have a date & time associated with when the documentation was changed. When the change takes place, the new change doesn't wipe out the old but leaves the old model available for review. The purpose would be to let it continue to operate but creating unneeded deprecation can add to over-complication without knowing where the complexity was added in.

# Will the documentation attempt to be as distinct as possible? What will be the limit of detail?

The limit will be based on the shape, nature, behavior, and what is known about the scope or set of scopes it touches.

# Can this support Neural Networks that would normally just run on Windows?

Ordinarily, yes. However, it can as long as python & wine developers don't disagree on how to handle and respect information obtained or given to or about them. What is likely is that, yes, this will also help find kinks in security and test the security model of each app before they get released for use by the general public.

# Did a military professional write this?

No. I am not from the military. However, I do hope to assist in making AI possible enough to keep a record of what happened to the point of death. The reason I do not operate as most military professionals do is because I am only seeing one side of the picture. But because I am only seeing one perspective of the picture, I have to build a neural network, one that can make use of those pictures. And my thinking was that if I could build an AI that could cobble as accurately as possible the details to the events pertaining to certain types of crime, it may even be spottable and preventable.

# Is this only meant for military application?

Nope. Use it for changing your mind is as simple as asking yourself to do it as long as you actually do the work needed. The point of thinking is to be applicably creative. With an AI of oneself and a platform that is mostly compatible with nearly any device, I want an AI that is based on my brain matter. I feel that an AI of me could make the world a better place. Some things aren't determined by who has the most money, and that includes a system of thinking that gives potential victims the ability to reach out before the issue becomes worse. My thinking also included therapists, where the issue maybe difficult to diagnose. PTSD or PTSD like symptoms are difficult to spot even for some patients with it. This type of tool (the AI of oneself) is meant to help the disabled.

Like all good things, if it is done right, it will be like they had no disabilities at all. And to me, that is the honorable & fair thing to do, even for someone who may be homeless.

# How can I use this to solve my problems? How can I master communication as you have?

Learn to develop with similar tooling and gain mastery. In enough time, if you're honest even about critical thinking and solving problems including the problems others may be going through, you too can take this path. Even if you started at a crap job. The mastery of words comes from not abusing them. Both parts to the art, the glyph drawing and connections to the abstract information about the words the glyphs represent is as important as basic algebra. If you don't know how to use the tools for analysis correctly, you paralyze you because of some level of dishonesty you were harboring. If someone is fear mongering, let them because everything they will pull on your way up is just them hating the refuse & litter that will stick to them. The only solution to even a person about to use your words against you is to let them. Let them guess and check. Because all of the song & dance they're a part of what they're doing is looking for a way to push your buttons & then lie about what you said. Then tell the bits they left out, and correct them when they lie.
